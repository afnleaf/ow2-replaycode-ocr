# Database Configuration & Volume Removal Summary

## Problem
PostgreSQL authentication was failing with the error:
```
FATAL: password authentication failed for user "ow2_user"
```

The root cause was that PostgreSQL found existing database data and skipped initialization, keeping old credentials that didn't match the current environment variables.

## Solution Overview
1. **Remove existing PostgreSQL volumes** to force fresh initialization
2. **Add proper startup dependencies** to ensure database is ready before bot connects
3. **Implement connection retry logic** in the application

## Key Steps

### 1. Clean Existing Data
```bash
# Stop containers and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q | grep postgres)

# Verify cleanup
docker volume ls
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
**`.env` file:**
```env
DB_HOST=host
DB_NAME=name
DB_USER=blalasad
DB_PASSWORD=yeahokimgonnaleakenv
DB_PORT=numbers
```

### 3. Docker Compose Updates
**Added dependency management:**
```yaml
ow2-replaycode-ocr:
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
```

**PostgreSQL health check:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${DB_USER} -d ${DB_NAME}"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
```

### 4. Application-Level Retry Logic
Added exponential backoff retry mechanism for database connections to handle temporary connectivity issues during startup.

## Result
✅ Fresh PostgreSQL initialization with correct credentials  
✅ Successful database connection  
✅ Working test data insertion and retrieval  
✅ Proper startup orchestration between services  

## Key Takeaway
**Docker volumes persist data between container restarts.** When PostgreSQL finds existing data, it skips initialization scripts. Always remove volumes when changing database credentials or configuration.
